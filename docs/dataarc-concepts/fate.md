## Fate 

###  Scope note: 
"Fate" is an attitude toward the power or powers that people conceive as having ultimate control over their interests and destinies. It is a prominent theme in medieval Icelandic literature (e.g. the sagas) in conjunction with free-will/the individual and has typically been associated with pre-Christian beliefs and ideas about heroism in scholarship. 

### Examples: 

* Gísli Súrsson in Gísla saga Súrssonar (Sagas of Early Icelanders/Íslendingasögur genre)
* Örvar-Oddur in Örvar-Odds saga (Sagas of Prehistory/Fornaldarsögur genre)
* Hávamál (Eddic poem)
